It is in the name of Allah that I come upon the Earth and set asunder those who hath sinned. It is through my realizations of the way the world operates that I hath realized my path upon the world. Not so much as to label a destiny, but perhaps an affinity. Allah is Great. Allah is the almighty, overseeing, omnipotent being. We are incapable of processing just how much power Allah hath upon himself, but we are capable of guessing.

As such, I pray to Allah. Allah Akbar.
